Summary:
- Refactored Zustand stores to feature-folder pattern (types/selectors/hooks/actions) with shared MMKV adapter.
- Updated all store consumers and fixed download queue regression (queue ref sync + added count).
- Updated Zustand guidance docs and validated usage patterns.
- Backend messages endpoint now deduplicates attachments per message by filename to avoid repeated files.
- Client attachment fetching collapses duplicates by filename before enqueueing downloads.
- Download queue enqueue adds filename-level dedup guard to prevent race-condition duplicates.
- Fixed large file download crash by switching from in-memory base64 conversion to RNFetchBlob streaming.
- RNFetchBlob now streams directly to disk using native path (stripped file:// prefix from expo-file-system URIs).
